# About me 
- I started programming in 2018, when I was 13. Over the years, I've explored many different technologies and languages, which are: python; HTML/CSS/JS; C++; Lua/Roblox; and C#/Unity. 
- My favourite language is python with c++ second. 
- My goals include getting in UWaterloo's CS program, and work at a big tech company in the future.
